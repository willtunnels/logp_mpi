LogP/MPI version history:

Release 1.0: February 2000
Release 1.1: April 2000
Release 1.2: July 2000
Release 1.3: January 2003
  - some /bin/sh implementations have problems with "set";
    now use awk in logp_plot;
  - due to rounding errors, a sqrt(negative) could be triggered in
    the statistics code in some cases;
  - L is now maintain as a double, like the others;
    useful for very small latencies on fast interconnects.
Release 1.4:
  - L now printed in seconds for consistency, like all the other measures
  - added flag -g-size <sz> in case g(0) measurements give unreliable
    results due to MPI implementation issues.
    If this happens, try "-g-size 4" or "-g-size 16".
